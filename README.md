Description of the project
The goal of the AirBnB project is to deploy on my server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
It does not implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher-level programming track.

Description of the command interpreter

It is a library written in C which allows the creation of programs that can accept commands given interactively by the user or programs that are sequences of commands.
Its main role is to read, interpret, and execute commands that are either entered by the user or called by an application. When a user types a command into the command-line interface, the command interpreter reads this input and determines what action the operating system needs to take.
How to start it

1. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt
2. Navigate to the Location of the Command Interpreter if necessary:
If the command interpreter is installed globally or accessible from any directory, you can skip this step.
If the command interpreter is located in a specific directory, use the cd command to navigate to that directory in the terminal.
3. Execute the Command Interpreter
4. Start Interacting with the Command Interpreter
